# Eloquence
Eloquence is a web application designed to help non-native English speakers refine their communication. It offers two core functionalities:

Rephrasing: Takes user input and transforms it into more confident, grammatically correct English sentences, utilizing the Google Vertex AI text-bison model.
Speech Synthesis and Recognition: Converts text into natural-sounding speech (Text-to-Speech) and vice versa (Speech-to-Text), powered by Google Cloud Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech services.
Key Features

User-Friendly Interface: The Flet (Python) framework provides a clean and intuitive graphical interface.
Google AI Integration: Leverages the power of Vertex AI's language model for accurate and nuanced rephrasing.
Natural Speech: Employs Google Cloud services to generate high-quality speech synthesis and transcription.
